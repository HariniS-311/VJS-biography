        <h2> Vijay Sethupathi Family </h2>
        <div align="justify" style="width:80%; margin:auto;">
    <p>Vijay Sethupathi was born into a middle-class Tamil family on January 16, 1978, in Rajapalayam, Tamil Nadu. He later moved to Chennai, where he completed his education and eventually started his journey into films. He is the second of four children, and as the eldest son, he took on responsibilities early in life, especially after the passing of his father. He has often credited his mother, who was a homemaker, as a pillar of emotional strength during his formative years. During his early career struggles, he worked multiple odd jobs to support his siblings, including stints as a salesman, phone booth operator, and accountant. While working in Dubai, he met Jessie, his future wife, through online conversations, and their relationship grew into something deeply meaningful. They got married in 2003 after he returned to India, unhappy with his corporate job abroad and determined to pursue his creative passion. Jessie has been a silent force behind his success — standing by him through financial hardships, career uncertainties, and the long years he spent doing uncredited or supporting roles before gaining stardom. Together, Vijay and Jessie have two children — a son named Surya and a daughter named Shreeja. Surya has already made a small mark in Tamil cinema by playing the younger version of his father in the hit film <i>Naanum Rowdy Dhaan</i> (2015).</p>

    <p>Vijay has spoken proudly about his children, often mentioning how they keep him grounded and remind him of the importance of staying true to his values. Despite his celebrity status, Vijay prefers to maintain a low-profile family life, rarely exposing his family to the media. He has said in interviews that he avoids taking his wife or children to film shoots or public events unless necessary, as he wants them to lead a normal and peaceful life away from the spotlight. He also actively avoids lavish celebrity lifestyles and prefers a simple routine that includes spending time with his wife and kids at home. Vijay’s commitment to his family is evident not only in his interviews but in the way he conducts himself publicly. Even when rumors or controversies arise, he rarely responds in anger or haste, often guided by the calm and wisdom instilled by his home environment. His humility, emotional intelligence, and respectful demeanor — rare qualities in the film industry — are often credited to the influence of his upbringing and the love and stability provided by his family. It’s clear that for Vijay Sethupathi, fame and fortune are secondary to his role as a devoted son, loving husband, and caring father.</p>
